# Total Pixel Space

An immersive, interactive landing page exploring the profound mathematical concept that every possible digital image exists as coordinates in an infinite space.

## üåü Features

- **Interactive Hero Section** with animated pixel visualization
- **3D Coordinate Space** visualization using Three.js
- **Animated Mathematical Concepts** with smooth scroll animations
- **Interactive Film Strip** demonstrating the illusion of time
- **Responsive Design** with modern UI/UX principles
- **Performance Optimized** with Vite and modern React patterns

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **Three.js** with React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern styling

## üé® Key Concepts Explored

1. **Pixels as Building Blocks** - Interactive pixel grid showing RGB color space
2. **Coordinate Space** - 3D visualization of mathematical image coordinates  
3. **Total Pixel Space** - The incomprehensibly large but finite number of all possible images
4. **Time as Illusion** - Interactive film strip showing static frames creating motion
5. **Navigation** - Consciousness as navigator through infinite possibilities

## üî¢ The Mathematics

- **Colors per pixel**: 16,777,216 (24-bit RGB)
- **Pixels per image**: 1,048,576 (1024¬≤)
- **Total possible images**: 7 followed by over 7.5 million digits
- **Comparison**: More than a googol, less than a googolplex

## üé≠ Interactive Elements

- **Pixel Grid**: Hover over pixels to see RGB values
- **3D Coordinate System**: Orbit and explore mathematical space
- **Film Strip**: Click frames to navigate through "time"
- **Concept Selector**: Interactive exploration of philosophical paradoxes

## üåå Philosophy

This project visualizes the profound idea that:
- Every photograph ever taken or that could be taken already exists
- Every face that could be seen exists as mathematical coordinates
- Time might be an illusion created by consciousness moving through static frames
- We are navigators in an infinite space of visual possibilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project uses modern development practices:
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Custom hooks for animations
- Intersection Observer for performance
- Responsive design patterns

## üì± Browser Support

Modern browsers supporting ES2020+ and WebGL for 3D visualizations.
